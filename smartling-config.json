     // Resource sets that are uploaded to Smartling. You can have one or more resource sets defined by file type.
     // Each set has following attributes
     //    type             - defines Smartling type for the resources. It is required attribute.
     //                       See supported types https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Supported+File+Types
     //                       If you have resources of several types you need to create several resource sets:
     //                       one or more for each of the type
     //    authorizeContent - defines whether uploaded content will automatically be authorized for translation.
     //                       Possible values: "true" or "false". Default value is "true".
     //    pathRegex        - regular expression that filters resources to send to Smartling. It is required attribute.
     //                       Expression has groovy (Java 7) format. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
     //                       Regex is applied to file paths relative to repository root. An example, you have file
     //                       https://github.com/user/test-repo/master/messages/test.properties. Regex will be applied
     //                       to "messages/test.properties".
     //                       Due to regex is located in JSON some special symbols must be double escaped. An example:
     //                       - "." must be double escaped "\\." (first slash is regex escaping, second slash is JSON escaping)
     //                       - "/" must be double escaped "\\/" (first slash is regex escaping, second slash is JSON escaping)
     //    translationPathExpression - groovy expression that is used to create a file path and name for translated files.
     //                                If this parameter is empty or undefined translated files won't be pushed back from Smartling to repository.
     //                                See https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Repository+Connector+-+Configure+your+Code+Repository for the details
     //    translationCommitMessage  - groovy expression that defining a translation commit message. If it is empty or undefined default message will be used
     //    smartlingDirectives       - string array with additional Smartling directives. Allowed directives depend on resource type.
     //                                See https://docs.smartling.com/display/docs/Supported+File+Types#SupportedFileTypes-java
